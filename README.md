Data Analysis

Sources of error and ways to compensating errors

1. Multipath: Multipath errors can be avoided by placing GNSS antenna that is away from reflective surfaces
2. Receiver noise: The receiver code noise is a white-like error and can be smoothed using a low pass filter. 
3. Satellite clocks: Satellite clock error can be avoided by downloading precise satellite clock information from an spaced based augmentation system (SBAS) or precise poitn positioning (PPP) service provider.
4. Ionospheric delays: The ionospheric delay is one of the largest sources of error that affects the Global Positioning System (GPS) positioning accuracy. By combining simultaneous measurements of signals at two different frequencies the effect can be minimized due to the dispersive nature of the ionosphere.
5. Tropospheric delays: The troposphere is refractive, its refraction of a GPS satellite's signal is not related to its frequency. The refraction is tantamount to a delay in the arrival of a GPS satellite's signal. It can also be conceptualized as a distance added to the range the receiver measures between itself and the satellite.
